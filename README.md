# :spades: Sudobot

This repo contains the files for a chatbot developed in Python, using the Rasa framework with custom actions.

Currently, Sudobot can tell Chuck Norris jokes and describe the weather in any location.

## üë∑‚Äç Installation

To install rasa and use this repo, run:
```
pip install rasa-x --extra-index-url https://pypi.rasa.com/simple
```
This will install all the libraries required by the bot.
Note that this bot should be used with python 3.6 or higher.

## ü§ñ To run Sudobot:

- Navigate to the cloned repo's folder
- Follow the instructions in the `Endpoints.yml` and `actions.py` files
- Start a `cmd or powershell terminal` in the cloned repo's folder
- Use `rasa train` to train a model.
- To run the bot, first set up your action server in a terminal window using ```rasa run actions```
- Talk to the bot using `rasa shell` or `rasa interactive` to talk to the bot in training mode

Note that `--debug` mode will produce a lot of output meant to help you understand how the bot is working 
under the hood. To simply talk to the bot, you can remove this flag.
